                <h2>Learning Ability</h2>
                <p>
                    This year is my fourth year of study in the university. With love of my major, I have studied the relevant core courses of my own research direction, laying a solid foundation for my future scientific research; and under the guidance of my tutor, I actively participated in a number of scientific research activities, and cooperated closely with team members to complete projects.
                    I have gained a lot in my undergraduate years, from studying and scientific research to personal qualities, all of them have been sufficiently cultivated and enhanced, which is a fulfilling and meaningful four years.
                    This is where the journey takes place...

                 <h2>“Chem is try”</h2>
                 <p>I still remember the professor's vivid remark in class, ‘If you write Chemistry separately, it's Chem Is Try’, which left a deep impression on me. In my research, I am innovative and enterprising, and I have the courage to explore, and I could cooperate with my team members in scientific and technological projects and internships to solve the difficulties and complete the projects, such as“the electrochemical synthesis of coumarin”and“the construction of sp2-carbon conjugated organic frameworks” and some other projects.This is where the story looks ahead...</p>

                <p>During my unforgettable summer at Oxford, I immersed myself in a vibrant academic environment. The experience was a blend of rigorous coursework and rich cultural exchanges. I attended lectures by distinguished professors and engaged in stimulating discussions with students from all over the world. Exploring the historic campus, I often found myself wandering through the beautiful gardens and libraries, feeling inspired by the legacy of scholars who came before.</p>
